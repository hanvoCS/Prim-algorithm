#  **Prim’s algorithm**



Prim’s algorithm is a type of greedy algorithms that find a minimum spanning tree. This project presents a code which generates a graph with random weight and connects edges. This code can check if the vertices less than 50 and let the user enter again if it is. In addition, it can check if the graph is connected graph or not depending on the number of edges. Therefore will not allow the user to enter less than ( N-1) edges where N is a number of vertices.  
If both conditions about vertices and edges achieved the graph and the adjacency matrix will generate.Then will ask for a source to begin choosing the **Minimum Spanning Tree** of the graph.
